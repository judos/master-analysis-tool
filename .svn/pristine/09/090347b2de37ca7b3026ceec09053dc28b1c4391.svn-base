WhatWasMostExciting
What was the most exciting part of the level?
When i had to open the final gate
Finding the lever for the exit, finding the way
To fight against numberous shadows at the end of the level
End of the game where you could switch on a light
Fighting the last shadows in the top level.
The Lantern move
The feeling created with sound effects and amazing visuals - but too dark!
top floor - escaping the group of shadows
the three shadows
Attacking the shadows, enjoying the music and graphics
getting chased by the shadows
When the shadow attacked me after the shaking door
the end with the three shadows
The concept of energy and shadows & lantern
first shadow, last shadow group
the shadow behind the lamps (hidden shadow under the ramp)
getting past the shadows
the top floor
Mechanical Eye
dodge the enemies
Elevator
The soundtrack was fitting
After you climbed up the narrow path you have a beautiful overlook over almost the whole Area, but you also still feel the threat in the darkness
finding the levers and finding out what they do

The ramp was too dark. nice idea with the light. I liked to kill the shadows, not only to freeze them. It would have been nice, if there were a big/more dangerous shadow at the end (boss)
It's a bit dark
Really good atmosphere. Good pacing with shadow-encounters. Rather easy, but perfectly fitting for a starting level. sound effects repeat a bit often.
Never got energy sucked out by a shadow - *yawn* Lantern could be a beacon of light itself, its strength depending on your energy level => shadows will be more aggressive and deal more damage when you are low on energy.
I liked the graphics and the atmosphere.
Camera was difficult to handle
mechanical eye seems over-powered, moving speed too low (was always sprinting)
I'd like to run ;) Make light with lantern and use some energy for this
Buggy...
More subquests & magical power to the avatar.
I almost felt like there were too much energy sources, or the eye should not totally refill your energy.
creepy, steps to loud, missing sound for exit lever, walk speed (sneak, sprint)
a bit too easy but the concept is interesting
Statue is a nice element
A bit too dark. but very interesting. I would play it (if there were more levels of course)
Find a way to make it clear what the levers do (ending). Maybe similar to portal where you see connections between lever and door
Better movement (sprint, walking animation (now it looks more like a ghost). Increasing IQ of monsters.
lever didn't work (to open the roof panels, therefore I couldn't use the mechanical eye). Shadows are stupid!
The ways cannot be seen easily. graphics and music is very good
During the 1st level, there seems to be no coherent story line. Is there one, or are the levels thematically independent? Tried to kill the first shadow. Would like a minimap of the level.
The movement of the avatar can be improved (the ability to run faster would be a nice feature, overall the movements are rather static)
I can't see a story since there are no further levels.
Good overall atmosphere of game. Sound fits well, though some effects are a little loud (steps)
